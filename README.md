🧠 Fashion MNIST Classifier with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset — a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, such as sneakers, t-shirts, and coats. The goal is to accurately identify the category of each clothing item using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
